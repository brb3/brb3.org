# Welcome

I'm a Software Developer living in Ringgold, Georgia with my wife Nicki.

I focus on C#, Go, and PHP programming primarily.

In my free time, I work on personal projects, or play with amateur radio or video games.
Also, I help run a community of local developers called [devanooga](https://devanooga.com).

If you'd like to contact me, the easiest way is via [email](mailto:bobby@brb3.org).
