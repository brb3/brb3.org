I've started work on a `kit-mode` for Emacs. This major mode provides syntax
highlighting and a few options for editing Kit programming languages files.

This is _very_ early work, so there's a lot to be done, but I wanted to write
some Kit, and wanted to have syntax highlighting. So here we go.

Check it out, PRs are very welcome: https://gitlab.com/brb3/kit-mode
